## About

Vertex Components is a library of React components that are used in Vertex projects.

This subproject is a part of the [Vertex](https://github.com/vertex-center/vertex) project.

The goal is to anticipate the creation of the Vertex website, allowing components to be reused between Vertex and its
website. Another objective is also to recode components with more tests and documentation. Future 3rd party apps will be
able to use these components.

**Disclaimer:** We do not advise you to use these components in your projects. They will likely change a lot in the near
future. We will make a stable release when we will be satisfied with the components.
