# Contribute to Vertex

The Vertex project is open source and welcomes contributions from the community! This software is mainly developed in [Go](https://golang.org/).

## Install Vertex to develop locally

- To install Vertex for development, please follow the instructions in [Install > Install from sources](./../../install/install-from-sources).
- You might also need to [install the Vertex WebUI](./vertex-webui) to interact with the latest version of Vertex.

Everything is set up for you to start developing!

## IDE

### GoLand

[GoLand](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/) is developed by JetBrains. It is a commercial IDE.

Vertex is ready to use with GoLand. You can open the project by opening the `vertex` folder.

- **Run configurations** are already set up for you. The only thing you need to do is to duplicate the "Run Vertex Kernel" configuration, and add `-user your_username` in "program arguments".

### Other IDEs

If you use another IDE, you can still develop Vertex, as the project is a standard Go project.
If you feel like an extra step is needed to make Vertex compatible with your IDE, please open an issue to [Vertex Documentation](https://github.com/vertex-center/docs).
