description: How to update Vertex and its dependencies.

# Updates

Updating Vertex or the different dependencies is an easy process. In the Web UI, go to **Settings**, then **Updates**.

Updates are fetched every time you click on "Check for Updates". When an update is available, a button will appear next to it. Clicking on it will start the update process.

:::warning Backup your data
While this process __should__ be safe, we recommend you to make a backup of your data before updating. To do so, clone your `live` and `live_kernel` folder in a safe place. This folder is located at the root of your Vertex installation, and contains all your data.
:::

:::info
Updating Vertex WebUI, Vertex Services or Vertex Dependencies takes effect immediately. However, a Vertex update will need a restart. This is marked with a warning next to the update button.
:::

:::info Vertex in Docker
If you are using Vertex in a Docker container, Vertex cannot update itself and will not be shown in the list. You will need to update the Docker image yourself.
:::

## Migrations **(advanced)**

Vertex automatically migrates your data when updating.
While this process is being tested on each new release,
a table of all migrations is available below in case Vertex struggles to execute a migration.

*e.g. If you upgraded from Vertex 0.11 to 0.12 and an issue occurs,
you can manually execute the migration 0 and 1 to fix it.*

After a manual migration, set the migration version in `live/metadata.yml` to the latest migration you executed.
*e.g.* `migrations: 0` if you only did the migration 0.

| ID | Version | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|:--:|:--------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0  | 0.12    | Rename `live/instances/*/instance_settings.json` to `live/instances/*/settings.yml`. Note that the JSON should be first converted to YAML.                                                                                                                                                 |
| 1  | 0.12    | Move `live/instances/*` to `live/apps/vx-containers/*`. This migration also commands Vertex to recreate all containers after restart, which is necessary to move Docker volumes to the new directory.<br/>You can recreate containers manually on the UI in `Docker > Recreate container`. |
