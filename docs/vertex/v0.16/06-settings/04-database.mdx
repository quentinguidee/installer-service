# Database

Vertex uses a database to store its data.
Vertex entirely manages this: you don't need to start a database server or anything like that.

This page allows you to choose which database to use. There are two options:

- SQLite: This is the default option. It's a simple database that stores all its data in a single file. This is the best option for most users.
- PostgreSQL: This is a more advanced option. This is the best option for users who want to run Vertex in a production environment.

## Migrate

You can migrate from one database to another by clicking the "Migrate" button next to the database you want to migrate to.
Vertex will start the new database and copy all the data from the old database to the new one. The old database will be deleted after the migration is complete.
