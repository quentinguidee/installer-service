# Security

This menu allows you to manage your SSH keys, without having to access your server manually.

### Add a new SSH key

1. Click on the `Create an SSH key` button.

2. Generate an SSH key if you don't have one yet:

    ```bash
    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "abc@example.com"
    ```

3. Copy your public key (the one ending with `.pub`), and paste it in the `Public key` field.

4. Select the user you want to add this key to.
    *e.g. If you have an user `nexa` on your Linux server, the key will be added to the `/home/nexa/.ssh/authorized_keys` file.*

5. Click on `Create`.
