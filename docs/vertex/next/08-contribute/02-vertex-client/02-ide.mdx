# IDE support

## WebStorm

[WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) is developed by JetBrains. It is a commercial IDE.

The Vertex Client is ready to use with WebStorm. You can open the project by opening the `vertex-webui` folder.

- **Run configurations** are already set up for you. Run the UI with the `dev` configuration.

## Other IDEs

If you use another IDE, you can still develop Vertex Client, as the project is a standard React project.
If you feel like an extra step is needed to make Vertex WebUI compatible with your IDE, please open an issue to [Vertex Documentation](https://github.com/vertex-center/docs).
