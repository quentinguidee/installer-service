:::warning{Backup your data}
While this process __should__ be safe, we recommend you to make a backup of your data before updating. To do so, clone your `live`, `live_kernel` and `live_docker` folder in a safe place. These folders are located at the root of your Vertex installation, and contains all your data.

### Update to v0.15.0

This update breaks compatibility with previous versions of Vertex. Please follow the following steps to update Vertex:

1. Backup your data (`/live` and `/live_kernel` directories)
2. On Vertex, go to **Settings**, then **Updates**. Click on **Update**.
3. Once the update is done, shutdown Vertex.
4. Delete entirely the `/live` and `/live_kernel` directories on your Vertex installation.
5. Restart Vertex.

After these steps, you can restore your data from the backup you made, by copying volumes from your backup to the new `/live_docker` directory.
