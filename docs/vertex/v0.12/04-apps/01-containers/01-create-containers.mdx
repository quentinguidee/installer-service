# Create containers

To create new containers, the easiest way is to use the Vertex marketplace.

1. From the "Vertex Containers" app, click on `Create container +`.

2. Click on the image you want to install.

3. In the popup, click on `Create container +`.

Once done, you can go back to the main page and configure the container as you want.

:::info
While Vertex Containers creates and manages your containers, and allows you to configure them easily, you still need to configure them.

For example, if you install Prometheus, the image is installed from the official Prometheus image. "Vertex Containers" will not add pre-defined configurations to it. So, for some services like Prometheus, it may be easier to install them from dedicated applications like "Vertex Monitoring", which will not only install the container, but also configure it for you.

Containers added from other applications will also be added to the Containers page.
A tag will be added to them to indicate that they were created from another application.
You can then manage them from here.
