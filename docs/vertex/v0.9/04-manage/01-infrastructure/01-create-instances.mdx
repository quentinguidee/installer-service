# Create instances

To create new instances, the easiest way is to use the Vertex marketplace.

1. From the instances page, click on `Create instance +`.

2. Click on _New instance_ next to the service you want to install.

3. In the popup, up to 3 different methods are proposed:

    - **Script**: This is the default method. This will clone the service source code, and install it automatically.

    - **Release**: This will download the latest release published on GitHub, without the source code.

    - **Docker**: This will create a docker container with the service, and manage it automatically.

4. Click on _Download_. Wait until the end of the download process.

Once done, you can go to the Vertex homepage and configure the service as you want.
