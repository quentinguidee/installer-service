# Develop a service

To create a basic service, you'll need this hierarchy:

```
service-id
├── service.yml
├── start.sh
```

1. `service.yml`

    This file allows you to describe your service to Vertex (name, description, dependencies...). Below is an example of `service.yml` file.

    ```yaml
    version: 1

    id: service-id
    name: Service Name
    repository: github.com/vertex-center/service-repository
    description: A small description of your service.
    color: '#DC382D'
    icon: simpleicons/redis.svg

    features:
      databases:
        - type: redis
          port: PORT

    environment:
      - type: port
        name: PORT
        display_name: Server Port
        default: 8080
        description: The port to expose the API of this server.

    databases:
      main:
        display_name: Database
        types:
          - postgres
        names:
          host: DB_HOST
          port: DB_PORT
          username: DB_USER
          password: DB_PASSWORD
          database: DB_NAME

    urls:
      - name: Redis
        port: 6610
        ping: /
        kind: server

    methods:
      script:
        file: start.sh
        dependencies:
          redis:

      release:
        dependencies":
          redis:

      docker:
        image: redis:latest
        dockerfile: Dockerfile
        ports:
          6379: 6379
        volumes:
          data: /opt/storage
    ```

2. `start.sh`

    This file is the script that Vertex will use to start your service.
    For example, if you want to run a go server, use this:

        ```Shell
        #!/bin/bash

        exec go run .
        ```

    :::info
    This script will only be used if the service is installed from sources, or if there are no binaries available in the GitHub releases of the repository.
    :::

These two files are everything you need to convert your program to a Vertex service!
