## Logs

This page displays the latest logs in real-time. Note that these logs are also backup in the `{instance_path}/.vertex/logs` directory, and are split in one file per day. These can be useful to investigate issues long after they appeared.

## Docker

:::info
This page is only visible if the instance uses Docker.
:::

This page displays some info about the Docker container, like its ID, name, image or platform.
It also allows you to restart the container.

## Environment

On this page, you can edit the instance environment variables.

## Database

:::info
This page is only visible if the instance uses a database.
:::

This page allows you to manage the database associated with the instance.
To change the database, you can use the dropdown at the top of the page.
Note that you must create the database before using it.

## Dependencies

:::info
This page is only visible if the instance is not using Docker.
:::

If a dependency is missing on your computer to run an instance, you can try to use the Vertex Dependencies tool to fix these in one click.

To install a package, select your favourite package manager, and click install.

However, package managers that need admin privileges cannot be used by Vertex. In this case, Vertex will give you the command you need to execute to install the missing dependencies.

## Update

Use this page to update the Vertex integration of this instance.

## Settings

On this page, you can edit the following settings:

* **Name:** The custom instance name.
* **Launch on startup:** Whether the instance should be launched when Vertex starts.
