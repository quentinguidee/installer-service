# Contribute

Thanks for your interest in contributing to this project! We welcome contributions from all people interested in helping out.
In Vertex, there is a way to contribute for everyone, no matter what your skill set is. Here are some ways you can contribute to our project:

- [Bug reports](./contribute/report-a-bug): If you come across a bug, please file a bug report on GitHub! Bug reports are the best way for us to improve the quality of the project.
- [Documentation](./contribute/improve-documentation): If you find any mistakes in our documentation, such as outdated information, grammatical errors, confusing wording, etc., please submit a documentation issue or pull request to let us know! This is a great way for first-time contributors to get involved with the project.
- And of course, [Code Contributions](./contribute/contribute-to-vertex/install)! If you're interested in helping out with the code, you can always find issues on our GitHub Issues page. If you are a first-time contributor, don't worry! We'll be happy to help you out with any questions you may have. And if you're interested in working on a larger feature or major overhaul of the project, please file an issue so we can discuss it first.
