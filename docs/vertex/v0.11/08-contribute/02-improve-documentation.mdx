# Improve the documentation

Contributions to the documentation are always welcome!
To guide you through the process, this page contains some information on how to contribute to the documentation.

## Installation

The documentation is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/). While this helps to know how Docusaurus works to develop advanced features, it is not required to contribute to the documentation.

To download and start the documentation locally, you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine, as well as [Git](https://git-scm.com/).

Then, you can download the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vertex-center/docs.git vertex-docs
```

Then, go to the `vertex-docs` folder and install the dependencies:

```bash
cd vertex-docs
npm install
```

Finally, you can start the documentation locally:

```bash
npm run start
```

The documentation can then be accessed at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Contributing

To improve the documentation, the recommended way is to edit the markdown files in the `docs/` folder. The changes will be available for the next major release of the documentation.

However, **if there is a major issue to the current documentation**, and only in this case, you can also edit the documentation(s) in the versioned_docs directory. This way, the changes will be available also for the previous versions.
