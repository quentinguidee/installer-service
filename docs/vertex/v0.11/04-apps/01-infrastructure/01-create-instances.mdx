# Create instances

To create new instances, the easiest way is to use the Vertex marketplace.

1. From the instances page, click on `Create instance +`.

2. Click on `New instance +` next to the service you want to install.

3. In the popup, click on `Create instance +`.

Once done, you can go back to the Instances page and configure the instance as you want.

:::info
While Vertex Instances creates and manages your instances, and allows you to configure them easily, you still need to configure them.

For example, if you install Prometheus, the image is installed from the official Prometheus image. "Vertex Instances" will not add pre-defined configurations to it. So, for some services like Prometheus, it may be easier to install them from dedicated applications like "Vertex Monitoring", which will not only install the service, but also configure it for you.

Instances made from other applications will be added to the Instances page. A tag will be added to them to indicate that they were created from another application. You can then manage them from here.
