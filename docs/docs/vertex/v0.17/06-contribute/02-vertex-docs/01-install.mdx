# Improve the documentation

Contributions to the documentation are always welcome!
To guide you through the process, this page contains some information on how to contribute to the documentation.

## Installation

To download and start the documentation locally, you need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) on your machine, as well as [Git](https://git-scm.com/).

Then, you can download the repository in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vertex-center/vertex.git
cd vertex
```

Then, install the dependencies:

```bash
corepack enable
yarn install --frozen-lockfile
```

Finally, you can start the documentation locally:

```bash
yarn workspace @vertex-center/docs dev
```

The documentation can then be accessed at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

## Contributing

To improve the documentation, the recommended way is to edit the markdown files in the `/docs/docs/next` folder. The changes will be available for the next major release of the documentation.

However, if there is an issue to the current documentation, you can also edit the documentation(s) in the previous versions (`/docs/v*`). This way, the changes will be also available for the previous versions.
