# Custom service

import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@vertex-center/components";

To create a basic service, you'll need this hierarchy:

```plain
{service-id}/
├── service.yml
```

## The service.yml file

This file allows you to describe your service to Vertex (name, description, dependencies...). Below is an example of `service.yml` file.

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="v3" label="Version 3">

:::info
The `v3` is only supported by Vertex v0.18 and above.
:::

:::tip
To upgrade from `v2` to `v3`, you need to:

1. Change the `version` field to `3`
2. Remove all `environment` of type `port`
3. Remove all `methods.docker.ports`
4. Create a new `ports` field with the port name and the port number

## The icon file *(optional)*

This file is the icon of your service. It is recommended to use a SVG file.
The path of the icon file is defined in the `service.yml` file by the `icon` field.
This path is relative to the root of the service repository.
