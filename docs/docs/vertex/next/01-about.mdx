# About

Vertex is a program that allows you to create your self-hosted server easily. Install, configure and start new services in less than a minute.

Vertex is designed to be installed on low-powered computers like Raspberry Pi, so prioritizing compiled languages like Go, Rust or C++.

:::warning
Vertex is currently in development. While it is usable, and I am using it in production, there may be breaking changes before the v1.0 release. You can keep following the project on [Discord](https://discord.gg/tGZV6X6ZJh), or by starring the [repository](https://github.com/vertex-center/vertex).
