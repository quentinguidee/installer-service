# Vertex Logs

Vertex Logs is an application that gathers all logs from Vertex.

## How to access the logs

Accessing the logs depends on how you installed Vertex.

* If you installed with **Docker**, logs are available in the vertex_logs volume.
* If you installed from **precompiles binaries**, logs are available in the `live/logs/` folder.

## How to read the logs

Vertex Logs will output the logs in three different ways simultaneously. Note that the two last methods are using one file per day (and changes automatically at midnight).

* **In the terminal (stdout/stderr)**. You can directly read them from the console.

* **In `vertex_logs_YYYY-MM-DD.txt` files**: this file is useful to analyze the logs manually, or to check why previous errors happened.
  ```json lines title="vertex_logs_YYYY-MM-DD.txt"
  2023-04-23 10:51:03 INF msg=stopping instance uuid=3d6a8d32-afe2-41a9-a94e-e00c17082d48
  2023-04-23 10:51:03 INF msg=instance stopped uuid=3d6a8d32-afe2-41a9-a94e-e00c17082d48
  2023-04-23 10:51:03 REQ method=POST status=200 path=/api/instance/3d6a8d32-afe2-41a9-a94e-e00c17082d48/stop latency=512.5µs ip=::1 size=-1
  2023-04-23 10:51:03 REQ method=GET status=200 path=/api/instances latency=65.583µs ip=::1 size=1728
    ```

* **In `vertex_logs_YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl` files**: this file, in the [JSON Lines](https://jsonlines.org) format, is useful if you want to parse the logs easily to use them from another service, or to analyze the logs from a programming language.
