# IDE support

## GoLand

[GoLand](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/) is developed by JetBrains. It is a commercial IDE.

Vertex is ready to use with GoLand. You can open the project by opening the `vertex` folder.

- **Run configurations** are already set up for you:
    - Use `Run Vertex Kernel` to run the kernel. Note that the kernel will also compile and start Vertex.
    - Use `Run Vertex` if you only want to test Vertex without the kernel. Many features will not work, as they require the kernel.

## Other IDEs

If you use another IDE, you can still develop Vertex, as the project is a standard Go project.
If you feel like an extra step is needed to make Vertex compatible with your IDE, please open an issue to [Vertex Documentation](https://github.com/vertex-center/docs).
