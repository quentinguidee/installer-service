# Reverse proxy

The reverse proxy allows you to bind URLs coming to your port 80, to different local ports.

## Create a redirection

To create a redirection, click on the `Add redirection` button. In the popup:

- In **Source**, enter the URL from which you want to redirect. *e.g.* `git.example.com`

- In **Target**, enter the URL to which you want to redirect. *e.g.* `http://127.0.0.1:3000`

Changes are applied immediately. Go to the source URL, and it will display the target.
