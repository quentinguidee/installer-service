# Contribute to Vertex WebUI

The Vertex WebUI project is open source and welcomes contributions from the community! This software is mainly developed in [React](https://react.dev/).

## Install Vertex WebUI to develop locally

First, you must have a working Vertex server running, whether it is a development server or a production server. Then, you can follow the instructions below to install Vertex WebUI.
Please note that you must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine, as well as [Git](https://git-scm.com/).

### Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/vertex-center/vertex-webui.git
```

Then, go to the `vertex-webui` folder and install the dependencies:

```bash
cd vertex-webui
npm install
```

Finally, you can start the UI with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The UI can then be accessed at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

## IDE

### WebStorm

[WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) is developed by JetBrains. It is a commercial IDE.

Vertex WebUI is ready to use with WebStorm. You can open the project by opening the `vertex-webui` folder.

- **Run configurations** are already set up for you. Run the UI with the `dev` configuration.

### Other IDEs

If you use another IDE, you can still develop Vertex WebUI, as the project is a standard React project.
If you feel like an extra step is needed to make Vertex WebUI compatible with your IDE, please open an issue to [Vertex Documentation](https://github.com/vertex-center/docs).
